            The Grand Renaissance Dam is the biggest in Africa currently (it is not finished, yet), the primary purpose of 
            the dam is to bring electricity to more than half of Ethiopians who don’t have access at home and for electricity
            export to neighbouring countries. 85% of the nile river starts from Ethiopia and in the colonial time Ethiopia forced
            to sign an agreement to not use the Nile river for any purpose and It flows for hundreds of years with out Ethiopia 
            benefiting from it but the neighbouring country like Sudan and Egypt. Ethiopia being the poorest country in the world 
            and all the economic hardships with a population of 90+ million, starting the construction was considered as a political 
            and economical suicide. All the powerful country warns Ethiopia not to build the dam and said they will not fund it nor 
            support it. But The prime minister did a good job convincing his people to fund the dam by any means necessary and he was a 
            tough leader, in a tough place, ready to take difficult decissions so the construction begun under his administration in 2011. 
            The dam is still funding by the government and the people of Ethiopia and its around 5billion USD and the construction created 
            up to 12000 jobs. The dam will be the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa as well as the seventh largest in the world 
            when completed, with a planned installed capacity of 6.45 gigawatts,

            As a leader, your people should be the source of your strength and what this dam showed me and inspired me is, 
            when people united everything is possible!</p>
