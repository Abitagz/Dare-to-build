 # Dare To Build

   This is a tribute page for the late prime minister of Ethiopia, Meles Zenawi and his dedication on building the Nile Dam that is the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa.

  ## Who was he ?

  He drop out from a medical school to Join a gorilla fight against the communist regime at the time, and win the fight in 1991 and become a prime minister for 20 years until his death in 2012 at age 57. While he was a prime minister he continues with his education and acquired a First Class M.A. in Business Administration from the open University of the United Kingdom in 1995 and a MSc. In Economics from the Erasmus University of the Netherlands in 2004.

  ## The Grand Renaissance dam

   The Grand Renaissance Dam is the biggest in Africa currently (it is not finished, yet!) the primary purpose of the dam is to bring electricity to more than half of Ethiopians who don’t have access at home and for electricity export to neighbouring countries. 85% of the nile river starts from Ethiopia and in the colonial time Ethiopia forced to sign an agreement to not use the Nile river for any purpose and It flows for hundreds of years with out Ethiopia benefiting from it except for the neighbouring countries like Sudan and Egypt. Ethiopia being the poorest country in the world with a population of 90+ million (now it is about 110Million), the construction was considered as a political and economical suicide. All the powerful country warned Ethiopia not to build the dam and said they will not fund it nor support it. But The prime minister did a good job convincing his people to fund the dam by any means necessary and he was a tough leader, in a tough place, ready to take difficult decissions so the construction begun under his administration in 2011. The dam is still funding by the government and the people of Ethiopia and its costs around 5billion USD and the construction created up to 12000 jobs. The dam will be the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa as well as the seventh largest in the world when completed, with a planned installed capacity of 6.45 gigawatts.
    
   As a leader, your people should be the source of your strength and what this dam showed me and inspired me is, when people united everything is possible!
