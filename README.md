  ## The Nile Grand Renaissance Dam

    This website is to inspire people, getting out of the ordinary because often we inspired by one person or few but not by 110million.
    These 110 people inspired me everytime I read about this by coming together and building the biggest dam in Africa by putting aside their religion and political differences. That's huge for me!
